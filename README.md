# My-Name
This is a Project I created for anyone just starting out in CSS and Open-Source. The Project as of now contains an example div, you can add a similar section with your name and something about yourself, or you could go all the way and add something extra too. Consider this a learning exercise and your initial step into the world of contribution and Open-Source. If you like the idea of this project make sure to share it with your friends. You can see what the Web Page currently looks like, [here](https://vansh-goel.github.io/My-Name/)

## How to get Started
- I would suggest you to get some hands-on experience with HTML and Basic CSS first, on your local machine
- After making sure that you're comfortable, start by editing the HTML and CSS files given in the repository 
- Along with the changes made to the code add your name in the CONTRIBUTORS.md file
- This is a learning experience so don't worry too much about it, just get started. Let's all build this WebPage together!
- You can refer [here](https://github.com/vansh-goel/My-Name/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributing to this repository
